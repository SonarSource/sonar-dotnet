<p>A procedure that grows too large tends to aggregate too many responsibilities.</p>
<p>Such procedures inevitably become harder to understand and therefore harder to maintain. </p>
<p>Above a specific threshold, it is strongly advised to refactor into smaller procedures which focus on well-defined tasks.</p>
<p>Those smaller procedures will not only be easier to understand but also probably easier to test.</p>

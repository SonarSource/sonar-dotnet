<p>Because it is easy to extract strings from an application source code or binary, credentials should not be hard-coded. This is particularly true
for applications that are distributed or that are open-source.</p>
<p>In the past, it has led to the following vulnerabilities:</p>
<ul>
  <li> <a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2019-13466">CVE-2019-13466</a> </li>
  <li> <a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-15389">CVE-2018-15389</a> </li>
</ul>
<p>Credentials should be stored outside of the code in a configuration file, a database, or a management service for secrets. </p>
<p>This rule flags instances of hard-coded credentials used in database and LDAP connections. It looks for hard-coded credentials in connection
strings, and for variable names that match any of the patterns from the provided list.</p>
<p>It's recommended to customize the configuration of this rule with additional credential words such as "oauthToken", "secret", ...</p>
<h2>Ask Yourself Whether</h2>
<ul>
  <li> Credentials allows access to a sensitive component like a database, a file storage, an API or a service. </li>
  <li> Credentials are used in production environments. </li>
  <li> Application re-distribution is required before updating the credentials. </li>
</ul>
<p>There is a risk if you answered yes to any of those questions.</p>
<h2>Recommended Secure Coding Practices</h2>
<ul>
  <li> Store the credentials in a configuration file that is not pushed to the code repository. </li>
  <li> Store the credentials in a database. </li>
  <li> Use your cloud provider's service for managing secrets. </li>
  <li> If the a password has been disclosed through the source code: change it. </li>
</ul>
<h2>Sensitive Code Example</h2>
<pre>
Dim username As String = "admin"
Dim password As String = "Password123" ' Sensitive
Dim usernamePassword As String = "user=admin&amp;password=Password123" ' Sensitive
Dim url As String = "scheme://user:Admin123@domain.com" ' Sensitive
</pre>
<h2>Compliant Solution</h2>
<pre>
Dim username As String = "admin"
Dim password As String = GetEncryptedPassword()
Dim usernamePassword As String = String.Format("user={0}&amp;password={1}", GetEncryptedUsername(), GetEncryptedPassword())
Dim url As String = $"scheme://{username}:{password}@domain.com"

Dim url2 As String= "http://guest:guest@domain.com" ' Compliant
Const Password_Property As String = "custom.password" ' Compliant
</pre>
<h2>Exceptions</h2>
<ul>
  <li> Issue is not raised when URI username and password are the same. </li>
  <li> Issue is not raised when searched pattern is found in variable name and value. </li>
</ul>

<p>Having a variable with the same name in two unrelated classes is fine, but do the same thing within a class hierarchy and you’ll get confusion at
best, chaos at worst.</p>
<h2>Noncompliant Code Example</h2>
<pre>
Public Class Fruit

    Protected Ripe As Season
    Protected Flesh As Color

    ' ...

End Class

Public Class Raspberry
    Inherits Fruit

    Private Ripe As Boolean         ' Noncompliant
    Private Shared FLESH As Color   ' Noncompliant

    ' ...

End Class
</pre>
<h2>Compliant Solution</h2>
<pre>
Public Class Fruit

    Protected Ripe As Season
    Protected Flesh As Color

    ' ...

End Class

Public Class Raspberry
    Inherits Fruit

    Private Riped As Boolean
    Private Shared FLESH_COLOR As Color   ' Noncompliant

    ' ...

End Class
</pre>
<h2>Exceptions</h2>
<p>This rule ignores same-name fields that are <code>Shared</code> in both the parent and child classes. It also ignores <code>Private</code> parent
class fields and fields explicitly declared as <code>Shadows</code>, but in all other such cases, the child class field should be renamed.</p>

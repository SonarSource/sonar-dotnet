<p>Since <code>abstract</code> classes can't be instantiated, there's no point in their having <code>public</code> or <code>internal</code>
constructors. If there is basic initialization logic that should run when an extending class instance is created, you can by all means put it in a
constructor, but make that constructor <code>private</code> or <code>protected</code>.</p>
<h2>Noncompliant Code Example</h2>
<pre>
abstract class Base
{
    public Base() // Noncompliant, should be private or protected
    {
      //...
    }
}
</pre>
<h2>Compliant Solution</h2>
<pre>
abstract class Base
{
    protected Base()
    {
      //...
    }
}
</pre>

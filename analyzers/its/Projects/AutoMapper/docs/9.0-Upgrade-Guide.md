# 9.0 Upgrade Guide

## The static API was removed

Switch to the instance based API, preferably using dependency injection.
See [here](Setup.html) and [here](Dependency-injection.html).

## AutoMapper no longer creates maps automatically (CreateMissingTypeMaps and conventions)

You will need to explicitly configure maps, manually or using reflection. Also consider [attribute mapping](Attribute-mapping.html).

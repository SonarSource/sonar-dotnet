# 11.0 Upgrade Guide

[Release notes](https://github.com/AutoMapper/AutoMapper/releases/tag/v11.0.0).

## Mapping _into_ existing collections

When calling `Map` with an existing readonly collection, such as `IEnumerable<>`, the setter will be used to replace it. If you actually have to map _into_ that collection, you need to change its type to a writable
collection, such as `List<>`, `HashSet<>`, `ICollection<>`, `IList<>` or `IList`. Alternatively, you can remove the setter or set `UseDestinationValue`.

## `CreateProjection`

If you don't use `Map`, just `ProjectTo`, you should use `CreateProjection` instead of `CreateMap`. That way you'll use only the API subset supported by `ProjectTo` and start-up should be faster.

## `System.ComponentModel.TypeConverter` is no longer supported

It was removed for performance reasons. So it's best not to use it anymore. But if you must, there is [a sample](https://github.com/AutoMapper/AutoMapper/search?q=TypeConverterMapper) in the test project. 

## Generating interface proxies is disabled by default

That was misleading for a lot of people. You can opt-in per map with `AsProxy` (and `ForAllMaps` if needed).

## `MapToAttribute` and `IgnoreMapAttribute` were removed

These were older attributes, unrelated to the newer attributes API. You can switch to the fluent API or implement the attributes in your own code. Check the tests for an example.

## Global pre and postfixes are now applied in all maps

They used to be applied only in the global configuration, now they are applied in all profiles, consistent with how settings work.

## `ForAllOtherMembers` was removed

That was used to disable mapping by convention, not something we want to support. When only used for validation, it can be replaced with `MemberList.None`.

How to build Nancy
==================

*NOTE* These instructions are *only* for building with Cake - if you just want to build Nancy manually you can do so just by loading the solution into Visual Studio 2017 and pressing build :-)

Building Nancy
--------------

1. At the command prompt, navigate to the Nancy root folder (should contain build.cake)
2. To run the default build (which will compile, test and package Nancy) type the following command:
  * On Windows type:
    ./build.ps1
  * On Linux/MacOS type:
    ./build.sh

*NOTE* On Linux/MacOS you need to have Mono >= 4.4 installed because Nancy targets .NET 4.5.2 for the full-framework build

After the build has completed, there will be a new folder in the root called "build". It contains the following folders:

  * binaries -> All the Nancy assembilies and their dependencies
  * packages -> Zip file containing the binaries (other configurations might be added in the future)
  * nuget -> NuGet packages generated from this build

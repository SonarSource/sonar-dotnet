<p>The rule targets the use of <code>DateTime.Now</code> call followed by some arithmetic operation.</p>
<h2>Why is this an issue?</h2>
<p>Using <code>DateTime.Now</code> calls within a subtraction operation to measure elapsed time is not recommended. This property is subject to
changes such as daylight savings transitions, which can invalidate the calculation if the change occurs during the benchmark session, or when updating
a timer. Moreover, <code>DateTime.Now</code> is dependent on the system clock, which may have low resolution on older systems (as low as 15
milliseconds).</p>
<h2>How to fix it</h2>
<h3>Code examples</h3>
<p>If the purpose is to benchmark something then, instead of the <code>DateTime.Now</code> property, it’s recommended to use <code>Stopwatch</code>,
which is not affected by changes in time such as daylight savings (DST) and automatically checks for the existence of high-precision timers. As a
bonus, the <code>StopWatch</code> class is also lightweight and computationally faster than <code>DateTime</code>.</p>
<h4>Noncompliant code example</h4>
<pre data-diff-id="1" data-diff-type="noncompliant">
Dim start = DateTime.Now ' First call, on March 26th 2:59 am
' Method to be benchmarked

Console.WriteLine($"{CInt((DateTime.Now - start).TotalMilliseconds)} ms") ' Second call happens 2 minutes later but `Now` is March 26th, 4:01 am as there's a shift to summer time
</pre>
<h4>Compliant solution</h4>
<pre data-diff-id="1" data-diff-type="compliant">
Dim stopWatch = Stopwatch.StartNew() ' Compliant
' Method to be benchmarked
stopWatch.Stop()

Console.WriteLine($"{stopWatch.ElapsedMilliseconds} ms")
</pre>
<p>If, on the other hand, the goal is to refresh a timer prefer using the <code>DateTime.UtcNow</code> property, which guarantees reliable results
when doing arithmetic operations during DST transitions.</p>
<h4>Noncompliant code example</h4>
<pre data-diff-id="2" data-diff-type="noncompliant">
If (Date.Now - lastRefresh).TotalMilliseconds &gt; MinRefreshInterval Then
    lastRefresh = Date.Now
    ' Refresh
End If
</pre>
<h4>Compliant solution</h4>
<pre data-diff-id="2" data-diff-type="compliant">
If (Date.UtcNow - lastRefresh).TotalMilliseconds &gt; MinRefreshInterval Then
    lastRefresh = Date.UtcNow
    ' Refresh
End If
</pre>

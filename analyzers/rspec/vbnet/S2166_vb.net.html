<p>Clear, communicative naming is important in code. It helps maintainers and API users understand the intentions for and uses of a unit of code.
Using "exception" in the name of a class that does not extend <code>Exception</code> or one of its subclasses is a clear violation of the expectation
that a class' name will indicate what it is and/or does.</p>
<h2>Noncompliant Code Example</h2>
<pre>
Public Class FruitException ' Noncompliant - this has nothing to do with Exception
    Private expected As Fruit
    Private unusualCharacteristics As String
    Private appropriateForCommercialExploitation As Boolean
    ' ...
End Class

Public Class CarException ' Noncompliant - does not derive from any Exception-based class
    Public Sub New(ByVal message As String, ByVal inner As Exception)
        ' ...
    End Sub
End Class
</pre>
<h2>Compliant Solution</h2>
<pre>
Public Class FruitSport ' Compliant - class name does not end with 'Exception'
    Private expected As Fruit
    Private unusualCharacteristics As String
    Private appropriateForCommercialExploitation As Boolean
    ' ...
End Class

Public Class CarException Inherits Exception ' Compliant - correctly extends System.Exception
    Public Sub New(ByVal message As String, ByVal inner As Exception)
        MyBase.New(message, inner)
        ' ...
    End Sub
End Class
</pre>

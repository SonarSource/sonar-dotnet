<h2>Why is this an issue?</h2>
<p><code>StringBuilder</code> instances that never build a <code>string</code> clutter the code and worse are a drag on performance. Either they
should be removed, or the missing <code>ToString()</code> call should be added.</p>
<h3>Noncompliant code example</h3>
<pre>
Public Sub DoSomething(ByVal strings As List(Of String))
    Dim sb As StringBuilder = New StringBuilder() ' Noncompliant
    sb.Append("Got: ")

    For Each str As String In strings
        sb.Append(str).Append(", ")
    Next
End Sub
</pre>
<h3>Compliant solution</h3>
<pre>
Public Sub DoSomething(ByVal strings As List(Of String))
    For Each str As String In strings
    Next
End Sub
</pre>
<p>or</p>
<pre>
Public Sub DoSomething(ByVal strings As List(Of String))
    Dim sb As StringBuilder = New StringBuilder()
    sb.Append("Got: ")

    For Each str As String In strings
        sb.Append(str).Append(", ")
    Next

    My.Application.Log.WriteEntry(sb.ToString())
End Sub
</pre>
<h3>Exceptions</h3>
<p>No issue is reported when <code>StringBuilder</code> is:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Accessed through <code>sb.CopyTo()</code>, <code>sb.GetChunks()</code>, <code>sb.Length</code>, or <code>sb(index)</code>.</li>
  <li>Passed as a method argument, on the grounds that it will likely be accessed through a <code>ToString()</code> invocation there.</li>
  <li>Passed in as a parameter to the current method, on the grounds that the callee will materialize the string.</li>
  <li>Retrieved by a custom function (<code>Dim sb As StringBuilder = GetStringBuilder()</code>).</li>
  <li>Returned by the method.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Why is this an issue?</h2>
<p>Duplicated string literals make the process of refactoring complex and error-prone, as any change would need to be propagated on all
occurrences.</p>
<h3>Exceptions</h3>
<p>The following are ignored:</p>
<ul>
  <li>literals with fewer than 5 characters</li>
  <li>literals matching one of the parameter names</li>
  <li>literals used in attributes</li>
</ul>
<h2>How to fix it</h2>
<p>Use constants to replace the duplicated string literals. Constants can be referenced from many places, but only need to be updated in a single
place.</p>
<h3>Code examples</h3>
<h4>Noncompliant code example</h4>
<pre data-diff-id="1" data-diff-type="noncompliant">
Public Class Foo

    Private Name As String = "foobar" ' Noncompliant

    Public ReadOnly Property DefaultName As String = "foobar" ' Noncompliant

    Public Sub New(Optional Value As String = "foobar") ' Noncompliant

        Dim Something = If(Value, "foobar") ' Noncompliant

    End Sub

End Class
</pre>
<h4>Compliant solution</h4>
<pre data-diff-id="1" data-diff-type="compliant">
Public Class Foo

    Private Const Foobar As String = "foobar"

    Private Name As String = Foobar

    Public ReadOnly Property DefaultName As String = Foobar

    Public Sub New(Optional Value As String = Foobar)

        Dim Something = If(Value, Foobar)

    End Sub

End Class
</pre>

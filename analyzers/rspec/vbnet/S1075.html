<h2>Why is this an issue?</h2>
<p>Hard-coding a URI makes it difficult to test a program for a variety of reasons:</p>
<ul>
  <li>path literals are not always portable across operating systems</li>
  <li>a given absolute path may not exist in a specific test environment</li>
  <li>a specified Internet URL may not be available when executing the tests</li>
  <li>production environment filesystems usually differ from the development environment</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition, hard-coded URIs can contain sensitive information, like IP addresses, and they should not be stored in the code.</p>
<p>For all those reasons, a URI should never be hard coded. Instead, it should be replaced by a customizable parameter.</p>
<p>Further, even if the elements of a URI are obtained dynamically, portability can still be limited if the path delimiters are hard-coded.</p>
<p>This rule raises an issue when URIs or path delimiters are hard-coded.</p>

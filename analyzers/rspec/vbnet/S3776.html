<p>This rule raises an issue when the code cognitive complexity of a function is above a certain threshold.</p>
<h2>Why is this an issue?</h2>
<p>Cognitive Complexity is a measure of how hard it is to understand the control flow of a unit of code. Code with high cognitive complexity is hard
to read, understand, test, and modify.</p>
<p>As a rule of thumb, high cognitive complexity is a sign that the code should be refactored into smaller, easier-to-manage pieces.</p>
<h3>Which syntax in code does impact cognitive complexity score?</h3>
<p>Here are the core concepts:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Cognitive complexity is incremented each time the code breaks the normal linear reading flow.</strong>
    <br>
    This concerns, for example, loop structures, conditionals, catches, switches, jumps to labels, and conditions mixing multiple operators.</li>
  <li><strong>Each nesting level increases complexity.</strong>
    <br>
    During code reading, the deeper you go through nested layers, the harder it becomes to keep the context in mind.</li>
  <li><strong>Method calls are free</strong>
    <br>
    A well-picked method name is a summary of multiple lines of code. A reader can first explore a high-level view of what the code is performing then
    go deeper and deeper by looking at called functions content.
    <br>
    <em>Note:</em> This does not apply to recursive calls, those will increment cognitive score.</li>
</ul>
<p>The method of computation is fully detailed in the pdf linked in the resources.</p>
<h3>What is the potential impact?</h3>
<p>Developers spend more time reading and understanding code than writing it. High cognitive complexity slows down changes and increases the cost of
maintenance.</p>
<pre data-diff-id="1" data-diff-type="noncompliant">
Function Abs(ByVal n As Integer) As Integer ' Noncompliant: cognitive complexity = 5
    If n &gt;= 0 Then    ' +1
        Return n
    Else              ' +2, due to nesting
        If n = Integer.MinValue Then      ' +1
            Throw New ArgumentException("The absolute value of int.MinValue is outside of int boundaries")
        Else                              ' +1
            Return -n
        End If
    End If
End Function
</pre>
<p>They should be refactored to have lower complexity:</p>
<pre data-diff-id="1" data-diff-type="compliant">
Function Abs(ByVal n As Integer) As Integer  ' Compliant: cognitive complexity = 3
    If n = Integer.MinValue Then    ' +1
        Throw New ArgumentException("The absolute value of int.MinValue is outside of int boundaries")
    Else If n &gt;= 0 Then             ' +1
        Return n
    Else                            ' +1
        Return -n
    End If
End Function
</pre>

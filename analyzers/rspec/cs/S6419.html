<h2>Why is this an issue?</h2>
<p>An Azure Function should be stateless as there’s no control over where and when function instances are provisioned and de-provisioned. Managing and
storing data/state between requests can lead to inconsistencies. If, for any reason, you need to have a stateful function, consider using the Durable
Functions extension of Azure Functions.</p>
<h3>Noncompliant code example</h3>
<pre>
    public static class HttpExample
    {
        private static readonly int port = 2000;
        private static int numOfRequests = 1;

        [FunctionName("HttpExample")]
        public static async Task&lt;IActionResult&gt; Run( [HttpTrigger(AuthorizationLevel.Anonymous, "get", Route = null)] HttpRequest request, ILogger log)
        {
            numOfRequests += 1; // Noncompliant
            log.LogInformation($"Number of POST requests is {numOfRequests}.");

            string responseMessage = $"HttpRequest was made on port {port}."; // Compliant, state is only read.

            return new OkObjectResult(responseMessage);
        }
    }
</pre>
<h3>Compliant solution</h3>
<pre>
    public static class HttpExample
    {
        private static readonly int port = 2000;

        [FunctionName("HttpExample")]
        public static async Task&lt;IActionResult&gt; Run( [HttpTrigger(AuthorizationLevel.Anonymous, "get", Route = null)] HttpRequest request, ILogger log)
        {
            // A compliant solution would be to manage the `numOfRequests` with an entity function or would use storage (e.g., Azure Blob storage, Azure Queue Storage)
            // to share the state between functions.

            string responseMessage = $"HttpRequest was made on port {port}.";

            return new OkObjectResult(responseMessage);
        }
    }
</pre>

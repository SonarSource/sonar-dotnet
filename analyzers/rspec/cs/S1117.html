<p>Overriding or shadowing a variable declared in an outer scope can strongly impact the readability, and therefore the maintainability, of a piece of
code. Further, it could lead maintainers to introduce bugs because they think they’re using one variable but are really using another.</p>
<h2>Noncompliant Code Example</h2>
<pre>
class Foo
{
  public int myField;

  public void DoSomething()
  {
    int myField = 0;  // Noncompliant
    ...
  }
}
</pre>

<h2>Why is this an issue?</h2>
<p>Overriding or shadowing a field or a property declared in an outer scope can strongly impact the readability, and therefore the maintainability, of
a piece of code. Developers may mistakenly assume they are modifying or accessing the class field/property when, in fact, they are working with the
local variable.</p>
<pre>
class Foo
{
  public int myField;
  public int MyProperty { get; set; }

  public void DoSomething()
  {
    int myField = 0;    // Noncompliant
    int MyProperty = 0; // Noncompliant
  }
}
</pre>

<h2>Why is this an issue?</h2>
<p>It is possible to subscribe to events with anonymous delegates, but having done so, it is impossible to unsubscribe from them. That’s because the
process of subscribing adds the delegate to a list. The process of unsubscribing essentially says: remove <em>this item</em> from the subscription
list. But because an anonymous delegate was used in both cases, the unsubscribe attempt tries to remove a different item from the list than was added.
The result: <code>NOOP</code>.</p>
<p>Instead, save the delegate to a variable and use the variable to subscribe and unsubscribe.</p>
<h3>Noncompliant code example</h3>
<pre>
listView.PreviewTextInput += (obj,args) =&gt;
        listView_PreviewTextInput(obj,args,listView);

// ...

listView.PreviewTextInput -= (obj, args) =&gt;
        listView_PreviewTextInput(obj, args, listView); // Noncompliant; this delegate was never subscribed
</pre>
<h3>Compliant solution</h3>
<pre>
EventHandler func = (obj,args) =&gt; listView_PreviewTextInput(obj,args,listView);

listView.PreviewTextInput += func;

// ...

listView.PreviewTextInput -= func;
</pre>

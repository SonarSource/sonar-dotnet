<p>There is no good excuse for an empty class. If it’s being used simply as a common extension point, it should be replaced with an
<code>interface</code>. If it was stubbed in as a placeholder for future development it should be fleshed-out. In any other case, it should be
eliminated.</p>
<h2>Noncompliant Code Example</h2>
<pre>
public class Empty // Noncompliant
{
}
</pre>
<h2>Compliant Solution</h2>
<pre>
public interface IEmpty
{
}
</pre>
<h2>Exceptions</h2>
<p>Subclasses of System.Exception will be ignored, as even an empty Exception class can provide useful information by its type name alone. Subclasses
of certain framework types - like the PageModel class used in ASP.NET Core Razor Pages - will also be ignored.</p>
<pre>
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.RazorPages;

public class EmptyPageModel: PageModel // Compliant - an empty PageModel can be fully functional, the C# code can be in the cshtml file
{
}
</pre>

<h2>Why is this an issue?</h2>
<p>A common code smell that can hinder the clarity of source code is making assignments within sub-expressions. This practice involves assigning a
value to a variable inside a larger expression, such as within a loop or a conditional statement.</p>
<p>This practice essentially gives a side-effect to a larger expression, thus making it less readable. This often leads to confusion and potential
errors.</p>
<h3>Exceptions</h3>
<p>Assignments inside lambda and delegate expressions are allowed.</p>
<pre>
var result = Foo(() =&gt;
{
   int x = 100; // dead store, but ignored
   x = 200;
   return x;
}
</pre>
<p>The rule also ignores the following patterns:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Chained assignments</li>
</ul>
<pre>
var a = b = c = 10;
</pre>
<ul>
  <li>Assignments that are part of a condition of an <code>if</code> statement or a loop</li>
</ul>
<pre>
while ((val = GetNewValue()) &gt; 0)
{
...
}
</pre>
<ul>
  <li>Assignment in the right-hand side of a coalescing operator</li>
</ul>
<pre>
private MyClass instance;
public MyClass Instance =&gt; instance ?? (instance = new MyClass());
</pre>
<h2>How to fix it</h2>
<p>Making assignments within sub-expressions can hinder the clarity of source code.</p>
<p>This practice essentially gives a side-effect to a larger expression, thus making it less readable. This often leads to confusion and potential
errors.</p>
<p>Extracting assignments into separate statements is encouraged to keep the code clear and straightforward.</p>
<h3>Code examples</h3>
<h4>Noncompliant code example</h4>
<pre data-diff-id="1" data-diff-type="noncompliant">
if (string.IsNullOrEmpty(result = str.Substring(index, length))) // Noncompliant
{
  // do something with "result"
}
</pre>
<h4>Compliant solution</h4>
<pre data-diff-id="1" data-diff-type="compliant">
var result = str.Substring(index, length);
if (string.IsNullOrEmpty(result))
{
  // do something with "result"
}
</pre>

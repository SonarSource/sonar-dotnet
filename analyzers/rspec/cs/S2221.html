<h2>Why is this an issue?</h2>
<p>Catching <code>System.Exception</code> seems like an efficient way to handle multiple possible exceptions. Unfortunately, it traps all exception
types, including the ones that were not intended to be caught. To prevent any misunderstandings, exception filters should be used. Alternatively, each
exception type should be in a separate <code>catch</code> block.</p>
<h3>Noncompliant code example</h3>
<pre>
try
{
  // do something that might throw a FileNotFoundException or IOException
}
catch (Exception e) // Noncompliant
{
  // log exception ...
}
</pre>
<h3>Compliant solution</h3>
<pre>
try
{
  // do something
}
catch (Exception e) when (e is FileNotFoundException or IOException)
{
  // do something
}
</pre>
<h3>Exceptions</h3>
<p>The final option is to catch <code>System.Exception</code> and <code>throw</code> it in the last statement in the <code>catch</code> block. This is
the least-preferred option, as it is an old-style code, which also suffers from performance penalties compared to exception filters.</p>
<pre>
try
{
  // do something
}
catch (Exception e)
{
  if (e is FileNotFoundException or IOException)
  {
    // do something
  }
  else
  {
    throw;
  }
}
</pre>

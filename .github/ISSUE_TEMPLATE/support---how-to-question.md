We strongly recommend that you ask support questions in the
[Community Forum](https://community.sonarsource.com/).

That includes problems with:
- running a SonarQube / SonarCloud analysis
- importing code coverage or unit test results results
- how to create custom rules
- how to import issues from third party analyzers

The community forum is monitored by more SonarSourcers and community members so your question is likely to be answered more quickly (if the answer isn't already available in the forum).

Also, the following documentation might be of help:
- Using [SonarScanner for .NET](https://redirect.sonarsource.com/doc/install-configure-scanner-msbuild.html)
- [Importing code coverage](https://community.sonarsource.com/t/9871)
- [SonarQube and the code coverage](https://community.sonarsource.com/t/4725)

Thank you!

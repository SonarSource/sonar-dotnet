## Labels

Labels are divided into several categories. One issue can have:

* multiple labels from Area category,
* only one label from Status category,
* only one label from Type category.

## Implicit rules

* Any issue without labels needs review.
* Every issue containing labels is confirmed.
* Issues marked as `Status: On Hold` are treated case by case. Reference timeout is 3 months without reply.

# Issue tracking

All issues for SonarC\# and SonarVB are tracked using [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/SonarSource/sonar-dotnet/issues).

You're welcome to submit any issue that you've found using the C# and VB.NET code analyzers in:

* [standalone nugets](https://www.nuget.org/packages/SonarAnalyzer.CSharp/)
* [SonarLint for Visual Studio](https://www.sonarlint.org/visualstudio/)
* [SonarQube](https://www.sonarqube.org/) plugins 
* [SonarCloud](https://sonarcloud.io/about) analysis

Please report all exceptions thrown from analyzer as well as False-Positive and False-Negative behavior. Try to provide a minimal reproducible example for each case.

You can request new rule or feature on [Community Forum](https://community.sonarsource.com/).

## Labels

Labels are divided into several categories. One issue can have:

* multiple labels from Area category,
* only one label from Status category,
* only one label from Type category.

## Implicit rules

* Any issue without labels needs review.
* Every issue containing labels is confirmed.
* Issues marked as `Status: On Hold` are treated case by case. Reference timeout is 3 months without reply.

<p>A public method can be called from anywhere, which means you should validate parameters to be within the expected constraints. In general, checking
against <code>null</code> is recommended defensive programming.</p>
<p>This rule raises an issue when a parameter of public method is not validated against <code>null</code> before being dereferenced.</p>
<h2>Noncompliant Code Example</h2>
<pre>
public class MyClass
{
    private MyOtherClass other;

    public void Foo(MyOtherClass other)
    {
        this.other = other; // Compliant: other not being dereferenced
    }

    public void Bar(MyOtherClass other)
    {
        this.other = other.Clone(); // Noncompliant
    }
}
</pre>
<h2>Compliant Solution</h2>
<pre>
public class MyClass
{
    private MyOtherClass other;

    public void Foo(MyOtherClass other)
    {
        this.other = other; // Compliant: other not being dereferenced
    }

    public void Bar(MyOtherClass other)
    {
        if (other != null)
        {
            this.other = other.Clone();
        }
    }
}
</pre>

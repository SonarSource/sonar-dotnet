<p>Duplicated string literals make the process of refactoring error-prone, since you must be sure to update all occurrences.</p>
<p>On the other hand, constants can be referenced from many places, but only need to be updated in a single place.</p>
<h2>Exceptions</h2>
<p>To prevent generating some false-positives:</p>
<ul>
  <li> literals having less than 5 characters are excluded. </li>
  <li> literals matching one of the parameter name are excluded </li>
</ul>

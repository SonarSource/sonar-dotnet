<p>Public fields in public classes do not respect the encapsulation principle and has three main disadvantages:</p>
<ul>
  <li> Additional behavior such as validation cannot be added. </li>
  <li> The internal representation is exposed, and cannot be changed afterwards. </li>
  <li> Member values are subject to change from anywhere in the code and may not meet the programmer's assumptions. </li>
</ul>
<p>By using private fields and public properties (set and get), unauthorized modifications are prevented. Properties also benefit from additional
protection (security) features such as Link Demands.</p>
<p>Note that due to optimizations on simple properties, public fields provide only very little performance gain.</p>
<h2>Noncompliant Code Example</h2>
<pre>
public class Foo
{
    public int instanceData = 32; // Noncompliant
}
</pre>
<h2>Compliant Solution</h2>
<pre>
public class Foo
{
    private int instanceData = 32;

    public int InstanceData
    {
        get { return instanceData; }
	set { instanceData = value ; }
    }
}
</pre>
<h2>Exceptions</h2>
<p>Fields marked as <code>readonly</code> or <code>const</code> are ignored by this rule.</p>
<p>Fields inside classes or structs annotated with the <code>StructLayoutAttribute</code> are ignored by this rule.</p>

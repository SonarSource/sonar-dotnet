<p>Not surprisingly, the <code>SafeHandle.DangerousGetHandle</code> method is dangerous. That's because it may not return a valid handle. Using it can
lead to leaks and vulnerabilities. While it is possible to use the method successfully, it's extremely difficult to do correctly, so the method should
simply be avoided altogether.</p>
<h2>Noncompliant Code Example</h2>
<pre>
Sub Dangerous(fieldInfo As System.Reflection.FieldInfo)
  Dim handle As SafeHandle = CType(fieldInfo.GetValue(fieldInfo), SafeHandle)
  Dim dangerousHandle As IntPtr = handle.DangerousGetHandle ' Noncompliant
End Sub
</pre>

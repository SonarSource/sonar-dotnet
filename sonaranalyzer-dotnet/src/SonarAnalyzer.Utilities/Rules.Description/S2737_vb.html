<p>A <code>Catch</code> clause that only rethrows the caught exception has the same effect as omitting the <code>Catch</code> altogether and letting
it bubble up automatically, but with more code and the additional detriment of leaving maintainers scratching their heads. </p>
<p>Such clauses should either be eliminated or populated with the appropriate logic.</p>
<h2>Noncompliant Code Example</h2>
<pre>
Dim s As String = ""
Try
    s = File.ReadAllText(fileName)
Catch e As Exception
    Throw
End Try
</pre>
<h2>Compliant Solution</h2>
<pre>
Dim s As String = ""
Try
    s = File.ReadAllText(fileName)
Catch e As Exception
    logger.LogError(e)
    Throw
End Try
</pre>
<p>or</p>
<pre>
Dim s As String = File.ReadAllText(fileName)
</pre>
<h2>Exceptions</h2>
<p>This rule will not generate issues for <code>Catch</code> blocks with just <code>Throw</code> inside if they are followed by a <code>Catch</code>
block for a more general exception type that does more than just rethrowing the exception.</p>
<pre>
Dim s As String = ""
Try
    s = File.ReadAllText(fileName)
Catch e As IOException 'Compliant, if removed will change the logic
    Throw
Catch e As Exception 'Compliant, does more than just rethrow
    logger.LogError(e)
    Throw
End Try
</pre>

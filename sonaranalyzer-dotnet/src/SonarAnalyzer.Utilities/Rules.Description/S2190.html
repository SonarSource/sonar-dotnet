<p>Recursion happens when control enters a loop that has no exit. This can happen a method invokes itself, when a pair of methods invoke each other,
or when <code>goto</code> statements are used to move between two segments of code. It can be a useful tool, but unless the method includes a
provision to break out of the recursion and <code>return</code>, the recursion will continue until the stack overflows and the program crashes.</p>
<h2>Noncompliant Code Example</h2>
<pre>
int Pow(int num, int exponent)   // Noncompliant; no condition under which pow isn't re-called
{
  num = num * Pow(num, exponent-1);
  return num;  // this is never reached
}

void InternalRecursion(int i)
{
  start:
    goto end;
  end:
    goto start; // Noncompliant; there's no way to break out of this method
}
</pre>
<h2>Compliant Solution</h2>
<pre>
int Pow(int num, int exponent)
{
  if (exponent &gt; 1) // recursion now conditional and stop-able
  {
    num = num * Pow(num, exponent-1);
  }
  return num;
}
</pre>

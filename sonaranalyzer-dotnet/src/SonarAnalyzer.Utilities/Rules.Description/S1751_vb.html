<p>Having an unconditional <code>break</code>, <code>return</code>, <code>(@)throw</code> or <code>goto</code> in a loop renders it useless; the loop
will only execute once and the loop structure itself is simply wasted keystrokes.</p>
<p>Having an unconditional <code>continue</code> in a loop can render the loop meaningless, or is itself wasted keystrokes, depending on where in the
loop it occurs.</p>
<p>Having an unconditional <code>return</code> anywhere other than at the end of a function or method simply renders all the rest of the code in the
method useless.</p>
<p>For these reasons, unconditional jump statements should never be used except for the final <code>return</code> in a function or method.</p>
<h2>Noncompliant Code Example</h2>
<pre>
Dim length As Integer

For i As Integer = 0 To length - 1
    foo(i)
    Exit For ' loop only executes once
Next

For i As Integer = 0 To length - 1
    Continue For
    foo(i) ' this is never executed
Next

For i As Integer = 0 To length - 1
    foo(i)
    Continue For ' this is meaningless; the loop would continue anyway
Next

</pre>
<h2>Compliant Solution</h2>
<pre>
Dim length As Integer

For i As Integer = 0 To length - 1
    foo(i)

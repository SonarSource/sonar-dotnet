<p>Floating point math is imprecise because of the challenges of storing such values in a binary representation. Even worse, floating point math is
not associative; push a <code>float</code> or a <code>double</code> through a series of simple mathematical operations and the answer will be
different based on the order of those operation because of the rounding that takes place at each step.</p>
<p>Even simple floating point assignments are not simple:</p>
<pre>
float f = 0.100000001f; // 0.1
double d = 0.10000000000000001; // 0.1
</pre>
<p>(Results will vary based on compiler and compiler settings)</p>
<p>Therefore, the use of the equality (<code>==</code>) and inequality (<code>!=</code>) operators on <code>float</code> or <code>double</code> values
is almost always an error.</p>
<p>This rule checks for the use of direct and indirect equality/inequality tests on floats and doubles.</p>
<h2>Noncompliant Code Example</h2>
<pre>
float myNumber = 3.146f;
if ( myNumber == 3.146f ) //Noncompliant. Because of floating point imprecision, this will be false
{
  // ...
}

if (myNumber &lt;= 3.146f &amp;&amp; mNumber &gt;= 3.146f) // Noncompliant indirect equality test
{
  // ...
}

if (myNumber &lt; 4 || myNumber &gt; 4) // Noncompliant indirect inequality test
{
  // ...
}
</pre>
